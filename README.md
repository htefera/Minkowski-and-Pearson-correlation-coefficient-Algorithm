# Minkowski Distance and Pearson correlation coefficient


### 1.  Minkowski Distance

Minkowski Distance is the generalized form of Euclidean and Manhattan Distance. The formula for Minkowski distance is given as

For the minkowski distance i used both recursion and higher order function to
implement it based on the following formula of minkowski distance.




### 2. Pearson correlation coefficient

The Pearson correlation coefficient is used to measure the strength of a linear association between two variables in a given datasets.


Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient returns a value between -1 and 1. The interpretation of the correlation coefficient is as under:
* If the coefficient is -1, it indicates a strong negative relationship which implies a perfect negative relationship between the variables in the data
* If the  coefficient is 0, it indicates no relationship or correlation exists between the variables
* If the coefficient is 1, it indicates a strong positive relationship. It implies a perfect positive relationship between the variables

For the pearson correlation coefficient we applied higher order functions on the following formula. <br>

To evaluate the final result, which is given on the left side, i divided the problem into
smaller manageable tasks as you can see on the right side and handle them individually and
combine the final result. It is a kind of divide and conquer strategy because i found it easy
to handle the problem.
