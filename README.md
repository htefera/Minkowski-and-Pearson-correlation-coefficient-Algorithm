# Minkowski ALgorith and Pearson correlation coefficient


### Minkowski Distance
Minkowski Distance is the generalized form of Euclidean and Manhattan Distance. The formula for Minkowski Distance is given as:

For the minkowski distance i used both recursion and higher order function to
implement it based on the following formula of minkowski distance.




### Pearson correlation coefficient


For the pearson correlation coefficient i used the higher order function to solve based
on the following formula. It is exactly the same with the given one but it is more simplified
to use it. <br>

To evaluate the final result, which is given on the left side, i divided the problem into
smaller manageable tasks as you can see on the right side and handle them individually and
combine the final result. It is a kind of divide and conquer strategy because i found it easy
to handle the problem.
